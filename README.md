# latexJournalTemplates
A collection of latex templates for journals that I may or may not be interested in.
These include:

* [PNAS](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/pnas) -- http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/latex.xhtml
	+ Research article
	+ Invited submission
	+ One-column mathematics artcile
	+ Supporting information

* [Genetics](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/genetics) -- http://www.genetics.org/content/prep-manuscript

* [PLoS](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/plos) -- http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex
	+ General submission template for all PLoS journals

* [BMC](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/bmc) -- http://www.springeropen.com/authors/tex

* [Springer](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/springer) -- http://www.springeropen.com/authors/tex


I have also included the [University of Manchester PhD thesis template](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/UoMthesis), which I used for my 2015 PhD thesis.

There is also my default note-writing/manuscript drafting [template](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/revtexNotes).
This, however, requires the *revtex* package from APS.

Finally, I have included some useful latex [documents/shortcuts](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/zz-other).
These include:

* [preamble.tex](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/zz-other/preamble.tex) -- a set of commonly used macros, mainly for mathematical notation.

* [supplement.tex](https://github.com/ashcroftp/latexJournalTemplates/tree/master/zz-other/supplement.tex) -- code block which resets all equation/section/figure/reference numbers and prepends with an 'S'.
This is for compiling a single doument of manuscript and supplemental information (SI).
Very useful for arXiv submissions.
